Automated HR Attrition and Financial Risk Analysis
Project Overview

This project analyzes 1470 employee records to identify attrition risk drivers, financial exposure, and workforce instability patterns. The objective was to provide leadership with data driven insights to protect and optimize a 5.2 million dollar workforce investment.

The final output is an executive dashboard built in Microsoft Excel using pivot tables, calculated metrics, VBA automation, and interactive slicers.

Business Problem

The organization experienced a 16.12 percent attrition rate creating financial loss, operational disruption, and workforce instability. Leadership required deeper visibility into:

What drives employee attrition

Which departments face the highest turnover risk

Whether compensation reduces attrition

The financial cost of employee turnover

Attrition was previously viewed as a people issue rather than a measurable financial risk. Reporting was manual, static, and lacked structured categorization for strategic analysis.

Technical Execution

To transform raw HR data into a strategic decision support tool, the following steps were implemented:

Created tenure groups to identify high risk service periods

Developed salary band classifications to analyze compensation impact

Built a financial attrition cost model to quantify revenue exposure

Designed automated VBA macros to refresh dashboards instantly

Integrated slicers for interactive executive reporting

The attrition cost model calculated annual salary multiplied by an impact factor of 1.5 to account for recruitment, onboarding, training, and productivity loss.

Dashboard Insights

The executive dashboard revealed several critical findings:

Thirty six percent of exits occurred within the first year of employment

Sales and HR recorded the highest attrition rates

Employees working overtime were three times more likely to leave

Higher salary levels did not significantly reduce attrition in Sales

Total estimated annual attrition cost exceeded 5.2 million dollars

These insights reframed attrition as a measurable financial risk rather than a qualitative HR issue.

Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis the following actions were recommended:

Implement a structured ninety day onboarding and mentorship program

Conduct a workforce capacity review to reduce overtime dependency

Introduce targeted retention strategies in high risk departments

Shift reporting from reactive HR tracking to proactive financial monitoring

Tools Used

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how analytics and automation can transform HR reporting into a strategic financial intelligence system. By quantifying attrition cost and automating data workflows leadership gained clear visibility into workforce risk and actionable strategies to protect profitability.
