# Automated HR Attrition and Financial Risk Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes 1470 employee records to identify attrition drivers, financial risk exposure, and workforce instability patterns. The objective was to provide leadership with clear data driven insights to reduce turnover and protect a 5.2 million dollar annual workforce investment.

The final output is an executive dashboard built in Microsoft Excel using pivot tables, calculated metrics, VBA automation, and interactive slicers.

## Business Problem

The organization experienced a 16.12 percent attrition rate, creating financial leakage, productivity loss, and operational disruption. Leadership required deeper visibility into:

- What drives employee attrition
- Which departments have the highest turnover risk
- Whether compensation reduces attrition
- The total financial cost of employee turnover

Attrition was previously treated as a people issue rather than a measurable financial risk. Reporting processes were manual and static, limiting strategic decision making.

## Technical Execution

The raw HR dataset was transformed into a structured analytical model through:

- Creation of tenure groups to identify high risk service periods
- Development of salary bands to assess compensation impact
- Construction of a financial attrition cost model
- Automation of dashboard refresh using VBA macros
- Integration of slicers for dynamic executive reporting

The attrition cost model estimated annual salary multiplied by a 1.5 impact factor to account for recruitment, onboarding, training, and productivity loss.

## Dashboard Insights

The executive dashboard revealed the following key findings:

- Thirty six percent of exits occurred within the first year
- Sales and HR recorded the highest attrition rates
- Employees working overtime were three times more likely to leave
- Higher salary levels did not significantly reduce attrition in Sales
- Total estimated annual attrition cost exceeded 5.2 million dollars

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following actions were recommended:

- Implement a structured ninety day onboarding and mentorship program
- Conduct a workforce capacity review to reduce overtime dependency
- Introduce targeted retention strategies in high risk departments
- Transition HR reporting from reactive tracking to proactive financial monitoring
